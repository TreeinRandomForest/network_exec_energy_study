Run Bayesian Optimization:
--> choose a per-qps file of featurized logs (each row represents a full run with its joules and latency measurements)
--> run: python3 simple_bayesopt.py featurized_logs_dir/<file> <N_trials>


Errors, Warnings:
- <add any here>


ToDo:
- produce plots for each per-QPS bayesopt run (each plot should show all chosen itr-delay and dvfs pairs up to the optimal choice)
